# Text_reading_alg
Machine learning algorithm for recognition, reading and transcription of plain text,
using opencv and tesseract open-source libraries.

It's written in c++ so you need cmake in order to compile the code.

You have my precompiled CMakeLists.txt wich you can youse for this code specifically.

To compile using cmake run those commands on the terminal inside the code directory along with the .txt file:
cmake .
and then 
make

this will create an executable wich you can run with ./ command.
